    # Localized sites, hat tip to Johannes -- https://gist.github.com/johanneslamers/f6d2bc0d7435dca130fc

    # If you are creating a localized site as per: https://craftcms.com/docs/localization-guide
    # the directives here will help you handle the locale redirection so that requests will
    # be routed through the appropriate index.php wherein you set the `CRAFT_LOCALE`

    # Enable this by un-commenting it, and changing the language codes as appropriate
    # Add a new location @XXrewrites and location /XX/ block for each language that
    # you need to support

    #    rewrite ^/en/(.*)$ /en/index.php?p=$1? last;
